# Basic Malware Script

This is a basic malware script that uses Nim and then generates shellcode using the "sliver" tool on Kali Linux. More instructions are available on shellcode generation via the corresponding module. This is intended for educational purposes only and is not intended to be used by anyone, especially on a non-consenting party. Use your own due diligence as I will not be held responsible for any actions taken using any of the scripts/tools/methods mentioned on any of my github repositories.
